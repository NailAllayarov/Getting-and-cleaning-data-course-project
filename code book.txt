Variables and data:

1. "X_train", "y_train", "X_test", "y_test", "features", "activities", "subject_train" and "subject_test" contain the data from the downloaded files.

2. "test_df" and "train_df" are the merged datasets for test and train data respectively.  They both were merged to the "all_df" dataset. 

3. The next step is the replacement of the activity column using descriptive activity names in the "activities" data. The result is stored in the "all_df2" dataframe.

4. The column names were edited:
- abbreviations in the column names were expanded
- strange characters in the column names and typos were removed

5. In the end "tidy_dataset" contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file.
